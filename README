NAME

    Pg::Simple - simple OO interface to PostgreSQL

DESCRIPTION

    Pg::Simple is a very simple interface to PostgreSQL.  It is
    patterned after the DBI interface.  Why not use the DBI interface
    instead?  The main reason is that it does not yet support cursors.
    This module does.  When the DBI Postgres interface supports
    cursors, one should use that instead.

    This module is designed primarily to ease reading data from a
    database.  All statements are executed within a transaction.

DEPENDENCIES

    You will need the Pg module, as well as PostrgreSQL.

INSTALLATION
